# Athena-Sine-Wave-Art-
1. Welcome! My project is called Oscillart Lucky Library. 
2. It took me 10 hours to fully finalize this project! 
3. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
4. Oscillart Lucky Library is a fun web app designed to motivate users with their studies through some "lucky tunes"! They are created by sine waves and users can input in a series of music letters to make any songs of their choice, with a few sample options available at the top.
5. I'm really proud of the extra customization and piano mode feature! It makes the notes sound less "electric" if you will :)
